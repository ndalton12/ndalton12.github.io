            For my freshman and sophomore years of high school, I went to Chelmsford High School. Chelmsford High has about 1,500 to 2,000 students,
            so it was pretty packed due to the aging infrastructure. Lunch time was especially bad. I did well in my classes, earning high honor roll 
            each semester. However, I wanted to learn more and have more opportunities, so I decided to go to Mass Academy.

            The <a href="http://www.massacademy.org/">Massachusetts Academy of Math and Science</a> is a free, co-educational, public school of excellence that enrolls approximately 100 
            academically accelerated 11th and 12th grade students from Massachusetts. Math and science are emphasized within a comprehensive, interactive 
            academic program. </p>
            <br><br> <!--
            Junior year is an intense courseload with classes that exceed AP depth. We took classes in physics, math modeling, science and technical writing
            , foreign language (Spanish for me), STEM I AND II, computer science, and humanities. In physics, we learn a curriculum that covers both 
            AP Physics 1 and SAT Physics topics. The workload in physics is thusly large, with homework every night in addition to practice problems and labs.
            Math modeling is a course that is about one-third based in modeling real life problems in teams with no "right answer" but instead guidelines to follow.
            The other two-thirds or so covers material similar to precalculus and is learnt by doing with no formal lectures. Science and technical writing, or STW,
            covers how to write technical materials and ensuring clarity and grammatical correctness in STEM papers. Foreign language is a full immersion class,
            meaning that only the target language can be spoken in class. This class covered a lot of cultural aspects as well and I found it to be enriching
            and interesting. STEM I follows the development of an individual project. A page on that is coming soon. STEM II is a group project where each team
            creates an assistive technology. More on that soon as well. In computer science, all students create their own websites at the beginning of the year
            and an app at the end of the year. In the middle, most students learn Java, but those that already know it complete an independent project. You can
            see mine on the <a href="proj.html">Projects and Research Page</a>, which also includes the app I made with my team. Last but certainly not least,
            Humanities is a sort of dual purpose course, covering both English and History, as well as cultural aspects such as art. In Humanities, we discuss
            a wide plethora of literature and do many essays to improve our writing and grammatical skills.

                    Physics is taught by Mr. Ellis. 
                    Over the year, we learned about kinematics, forces, energy, momentum, rotational mechanics, and more. 
                    For some chapters we do an extended word problem called an über problem. Our first uber problem was a kinematics problem
                    based on a rocket. The problem and my solution are shown <a href="pdf/uber.pdf">here</a>.

                    Another assignment we've had is the spring lab, which involved springs, as the name implies. This lab was for the energy unit.
                    My group used a ramp and a cart attached to a post at the top of the ramp. We measured how far the cart was displaced by changing 
                    the ramp angle. You can see a picture and the write-up in the PDF <a href="pdf/lab.pdf">here</a>.

                        Our first project is to create our own website, which is the one you see right now. 
                        Later in year we have a big group project to create an app that helps out the community in some way. 
                        You can see that app and another project I did in computer science on my <a href="proj.html">Projects</a> page.

                        In math class, we are mostly did larger problems in groups. For example, we did a project based on optimizing a bus
                        route for a school. In November, our class took part in HiMCM, a 36 hour math competition. 
                        There were two different topics from which you could choose to work on and our group choose a problem based on optimizing
                        warehouse placement. We overlaid various maps with the range of 1-day shipping from a given location and looked for 
                        solutions that covered all of the continental US. The paper we wrote for HiMCM is <a href="pdf/himcm.pdf">here</a>.

                        In math class we often use software called Mathematica, which is the language behind Wolfram Alpha. 
                        An example of one of the assignments we had to do in Mathematica is pictured below. In this assignment, 
                        my group had to find a method of calculating which gas station would be the optimal choice given a set of criteria.

                            and subjects to create a holistic learning experience. One essay we did was on ancient Egyptian love poetry,
                            which you can read <a href="pdf/essay1.pdf">here</a>. In this essay, I discuss how figurative langauge is

                            Spanish class is a total immersion style wherein we could only speak in Spanish.
                            Although it was hard for some, it provided us with a lot of experience and I think it really helped us develop 
                            our skills as Spanish speakers. We occasionally have to write essays in the class. We did a first person essay as one
                            of the characters from Los Diarios Motocicletas. I did mine on Ernesto (Che), which you can see

                            The end goal is for everyone to develop and work on their own large science fair project and present it at various showings.
                            My STEM project is based on creating a quantum algorithm for square root calculations. You can read more about my paper

                            STW stands for science and technical writing. In STW we learned how to write in a more formal and scientific fashion and 
                            how to effectively communicate information to our audiences. This built into the STEM class where we had to do a 
                            lot of writing about our STEM projects. I don’t find grammar and technical writing to be super fun, but we read a lot of 
                            interesting articles about science which made the class more interesting. One writing assignment I did is 
                            a mock grant proposal for the Engineering Girl contest. I did mine on saving tigers, the world's biggest cats. You can

            Senior year is a chance for students to take all their courses at WPI, essentially as a freshman in college. This year, I'm taking 
            courses in Mechanics, Robotics, Discrete Mathematics, Algorithms, and Calculus I-IV. We are also required to take a number of
            Humanities courses, for which I'm taking Macroeconomics, Psychology, Science Literature, and British Literature. Another
            important part of senior year is the Senior Independent Study Project (SISP).

                <h3>Robotics</h3>
                <p class="p-grey p-med">
                    Introduction to Robotics is a course that covers the mechanical, electrical, and computational aspects of robotics. This course
                    featured long lab projects and lots of homework covering torque calculations, solving circuits, and programming. Our final project
                    was to create a robot that could compete in a competition for placing tennis and ping-pong balls in small tubes. We had to complete
                    calculations and justifications for our design and write-up a final paper, which you can read <a href="pdf/rbe.pdf">here</a>.

                <h3>Psychology</h3>
                <p class="p-grey p-med">
                    In Introduction to Psychology, we covered behaviors, emotions, happiness, and much more. As a part of the class, we were required
                    to make a survey and have 10 people fill it out. Despite having a very small dataset, I decided to do some interesting data analysis
                    in my paper, <a href="pdf/psych.pdf">here</a>, which covers the influence of weather on anxiety. Some of the results 
                    I found to be surprising, and the I think the analysis provides solid insight into the data.

                <h3>Macroeconomics</h3>
                <p class="p-grey p-med">
                    In Macroeconomics, we learned about demand, supply, market equilibrium, opportunity cost, etc. Our final project required us to create
                    a poster exploring the economic status of a country. My group did our study on Sweden. 
                    You can see our poster <a href="pdf/poster.pdf">here</a>.
